## Topological Sorting  ##

Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.

 Notice

You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

The topological order can be:

	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
	...
Challenge 
Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?
