## Longest Consecutive Sequence  ##

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Clarification
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example

Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

----------
Since it requires O(n) solution, normal sort won't be work here. Hash probably is the best choice.
3 Steps:


1 create the hashmap to hold < num, index > 

2 scan the num vector from left to right, for each num

i, check whether num -1 is in the map (loop)

ii, check whether num+1 is in the map (loop)


3 track the sequence length during scanning.


	int longestConsecutive(vector<int> &num) {
	    // write you code here
	    unordered_set<int> map(num.begin(), num.end());
	    int ans = 0;
	    for (int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++) { 
	      if (map.find(num[i]) != map.end()) {
	        map.erase(num[i]);
	        int pre = num[i] - 1;
	        int next = num[i] + 1;
	        while (map.find(pre) != map.end()) { 
	          map.erase(pre);
	          pre--;
	        } 
	        while (map.find(next) != map.end()) { 
	          map.erase(next);
	          next++;
	        } 
	        ans = max(ans, next - pre - 1);
	      }
	    } 
	    return ans;
	}
