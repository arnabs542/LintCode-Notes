## House Robber II  ##

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 Notice

This is an extension of House Robber.

Example
nums = [3,6,4], return 6

这题是上一题House Robber的升级版
所以就会考虑到，最后一个和第一个房子是不能够同时进入的~要不然会告诉警察叔叔~~
所以分为两种情况~
0.不包括最后一个屋子~就抢劫0~n-2号屋子~
1.不包括第一个屋子~就抢劫1~n-1号屋子~
这样的话，return上面两种情况的最大值就好了~调用两次子函数求值，主函数取其最大值返回~

	int houseRobber2(vector<int>& nums) {
	    // write your code here
	    int n = nums.size();
	    if (n == 0) {
	        return 0;
	    }
	    if (n == 1) {
	        return nums[0];
	    }
	    return max(robber1(nums, 0, n - 2), robber1(nums, 1, n - 1));
	}
	
	int robber1(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
	    if (start == end ) {
	        return 0;
	    }
	    if (start + 1 == end) {
	        return max(nums[start], nums[end]);
	    }
	    int a = nums[start];
	    int b = max(nums[start], nums[start + 1]);
	    for (int i = start + 2; i <= end; i++) {

	        a = b;
	        b = c;
