## House Robber III ##

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example

	  3
	 / \
	2   3
	 \   \ 
	  3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

	    3
	   / \
	  4   5
	 / \   \ 
	1   3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
