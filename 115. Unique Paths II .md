Unique Paths II 

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

 Notice

m and n will be at most 100.

Example
For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.

与I有两点不同：

当(i, j)有障碍时dp[i][j] = 0

dp[0][j]和dp[i][0]未必为1.

dp[0][j] = obstacleGrid[0][j] ? 0 : dp[0][j-1]

dp[i][0] = obstacleGrid[i][0] ? 0 : dp[i-1][0]

当obstacleGrid [0][0] = 1时，return 0

	int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int> > &obstacleGrid) {
	    // write your code here
	    int m = obstacleGrid.size();
	    if (m < 1) {
	        return 0;
	    }
	    int n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
	    if (n < 1) {
	        return 0;
	    }
	    if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) {
	        return 0;
	    }
	    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
	    dp[0][0] = 1;
	    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
	        dp[i][0] = obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1 ? 0 : dp[i - 1][0];
	    }
	    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
	        dp[0][j] = obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1 ? 0 : dp[0][j - 1];
	    }
	    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
	        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
	            dp[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1 ? 0 : 
	            dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
	        }
	    }
	    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
	}
