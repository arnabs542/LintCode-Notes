## Kth Largest Element II ##

Find K-th largest element in an array. and N is much larger than k.

 Notice

You can swap elements in the array

Example

	In array [9,3,2,4,8], the 3rd largest element is 4.
	
	In array [1,2,3,4,5], the 1st largest element is 5, 2nd largest element is 4, 3rd largest element is 3 and etc.

----------
In a min heap, the root has the minimum (less than it's children) value.

So, what you need is, iterate over the array and populate K elements in min heap. Once, it's done, the heap automatically contains the lowest at the root.

Now, for each (next) element you read from the array, -> check if the value is greater than root of min heap. -> If yes, remove root from min heap, and add the value to it.

After you traverse your whole array, the root of min heap will automtically contain the kth largest element.

And all other elements (k-1 elements to be precise) in the heap will be larger than k.
