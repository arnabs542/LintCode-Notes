## Rectangle Area  ##

Implement a Rectangle class which include the following attributes and methods:

Two public attributes width and height.
A constructor which expects two parameters width and height of type int.
A method getArea which would calculate the size of the rectangle and return.

Example
Java:
    Rectangle rec = new Rectangle(3, 4);
    rec.getArea(); // should get 12

Python:
    rec = Rectangle(3, 4)
    rec.getArea()
