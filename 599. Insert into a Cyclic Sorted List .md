## Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List  ##

Given a node from a cyclic linked list which has been sorted, write a function to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be any single node in the list. Return the inserted new node.

 Notice

3->5->1 is a cyclic list, so 3 is next node of 1.
3->5->1 is same with 5->1->3

Example
Given a list, and insert a value 4:
3->5->1
Return 5->1->3->4

----------
Basically, you would have a loop that traverse the cyclic sorted list and find the point where you insert the value (Let’s assume the value being inserted called x). You would only need to consider the following three cases:

1. prev→val ≤ x ≤ current→val:
　　　　　　Insert between prev and current.
2. x is the maximum or minimum value in the list:
Insert before the head. (ie, the head has the smallest value and its prev→val > head→val.
3. Traverses back to the starting point:
Insert before the starting point.

It's tricky to think of case 3: 

Q: What if the list has only one value?A: Handled by case 3).

Q: What if the list is passed in as NULL?A: Then handle this special case by creating a new node pointing back to itself and return.

Q: What if the list contains all duplicates?A: Then it has been handled by case 3).

	ListNode* insert(ListNode* node, int x) {
	    // Write your code here
	    //Linked List is empty
	    if (node == NULL) {
	        node = new ListNode(x);
	        node->next = node;
	        return node;
	    }
	    ListNode* p = node;
	    while (p->next != node) {
	        if (p->val <= x && x <= p->next->val) {
	            break;
	        }
	        if (p->val > p->next->val && (x < p->next->val || x > p->val )) {
	            break;
	        }
	        p = p->next;
	    }
	    ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(x);
	    newNode->next = p->next;
	    p->next = newNode;
	    return node;
	}
