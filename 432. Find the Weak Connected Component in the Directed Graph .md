## Find the Weak Connected Component in the Directed Graph  ##

Find the number Weak Connected Component in the directed graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. (a connected set of a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by direct edge path.)

 Notice

Sort the element in the set in increasing order

Example
Given graph:

	A----->B  C
	 \     |  | 
	  \    |  |
	   \   |  |
	    \  v  v
	     ->D  E <- F
Return {A,B,D}, {C,E,F}. Since there are two connected component which are {A,B,D} and {C,E,F}
