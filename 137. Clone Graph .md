## Clone Graph  ##

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

How we serialize an undirected graph:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

- First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
- Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
- Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:


	   1
	  / \
	 /   \
	0 --- 2
	     / \
	     \_/

Example

return a deep copied graph.
