## Concatenated String with Uncommon Characters of Two Strings  ##

Two strings are given and you have to modify 1st string such that all the common characters of the 2nd strings have to be removed and the uncommon characters of the 2nd string have to be concatenated with uncommon characters of the 1st string.

Example

Given s1 = aacdb, s2 = gafd
return cbgf

Given s1 = abcs, s2 = cxzca;
return bsxz

----------
Initialize result as empty string.

Push all characters of 2nd string in map with count as 1.

Traverse first string and append all those characters to result that are not present in map. Characters that are present in map, make count 2.

Traverse second string and append all those characters to result whose count is 1.
