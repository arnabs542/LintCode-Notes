## Minimum Spanning Tree  ##

Given a list of Connections, which is the Connection class (the city name at both ends of the edge and a cost between them), find some edges, connect all the cities and spend the least amount.
Return the connects if can connect all the cities, otherwise return empty list.

 Notice

Return the connections sorted by the cost, or sorted city1 name if their cost is same, or sorted city2 if their city1 name is also same.

Example

Gievn the connections = ["Acity","Bcity",1], ["Acity","Ccity",2], ["Bcity","Ccity",3]

Return ["Acity","Bcity",1], ["Acity","Ccity",2]

答案就是 经典的 kruskal算法 求解最小生成树：

方式就是当前图只有点，然后我们把边从小到大排序，一条一条放进去，只要不形成环，那么这条边就是属于最小生成树上的。大致思路就是这样。

1. Sort edges by ascending edge weight.
2. Walk through the sorted edges and look at the two nodes the edge belongs to, if the nodes are already unified we do not include this edge, otherwise we include it and unify the nodes.
3. The algorithm terminates when every edge has been processed or all the vertices have been unified.
